A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Postmortems typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place. An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion. The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement. This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.

As your systems scale and become more complex, failure is inevitable, assessment and remediation is more involved and time-consuming, and it becomes increasingly painful to repeat recurring mistakes. Not having data when you need it is expensive.

Streamlining the postmortem process is key to helping your team get the most from their postmortem time investment: spending less time conducting the postmortem, while extracting more effective learnings, is a faster path to increased operational maturity. In fact, the true value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a positive culture around frequent and iterative improvement.

Why Do Postmortems?
During incident response, the team is 100% focused on restoring service. They should not be wasting time and mental energy thinking about how to do something optimally or performing a deep dive on what caused the incident. Doing this could further delay remediation efforts and convolute the resolution process. That’s why postmortems are essential—they provide a peacetime opportunity to reflect once the issue is no longer impacting users. The postmortem process drives focus, instills a culture of learning, and identifies opportunities for improvement that otherwise would be lost.

Without a postmortem you fail to recognize what you’re doing right, where you could improve, and most importantly, how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. Writing an effective postmortem allows you to learn quickly from your mistakes and improve your systems and processes. A well-designed, blameless postmortem allows teams to continuously learn, serving as a way to iteratively improve your infrastructure and incident response process. Be sure to write detailed and accurate postmortems in order to get the most benefit out of them.

Organizations may refer to the postmortem process in slightly different ways:

Learning Review
After-Action Review
Incident Review
Incident Report
Post-Incident Review
Root Cause Analysis (or RCA)
